This extension dynamically inserts a textarea into the page. When you click "execute" it runs "eval" on anything
in the textarea and executes the code as native JS. You can define a function, execute it, DELETE the function,
and it remains in memory to be called.


Many thanks to Radek Horsky for the patch!
